                        sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent
                        the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was
                        expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in.
                        I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day.
                        I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.

                        is pronounced kəvōTH, described as much like the word quoth 
                        but beginning the same as the Yiddish term "Kvetch."</p>

                    <h2>About the author:</h2>
                    <p>Patrick Rothfuss had the good fortune to be born in Wisconsin in 1973,
                    where the long winters and lack of cable television encouraged a love of
                    reading and writing. After abandoning his chosen field of chemical engineering,
                    Pat became an itinerant student, wandering through clinical psychology,
                    philosophy, medieval history, theater, and sociology. Nine years later,
                    Pat was forced by university policy to finally complete his undergraduate
                    degree in English. When not reading and writing,
                    he teaches fencing and dabbles with alchemy in his basement.</p>
